YOLO-based Recycling Waste Detection

This project uses a YOLO object detection model trained on our own custom dataset (~1500 images) to detect and classify recyclable waste into 5 categories: metal, glass, plastic, organic, and paper.

The model is integrated into a Flutter mobile application that performs live, real-time waste detection, making it suitable for practical recycling and sustainability-focused use cases.

The goal of this project is to improve waste sorting accuracy and promote environmentally responsible behavior through AI-powered automation.
